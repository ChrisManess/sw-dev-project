    "Alright the data is all here so let's roll out the barrel so to speak. Let's try some sentiment analysis. Now I may have mentioned in the harvester notebook that due to the poor quality of some of the OCR output I may be unable to retreive sentiment. Which would normally be the case if I did something like tokenization of words. Fortunately a bit of research has led me to the Flair library and a character level LSTM classification of sentiment. Using LSTM should allow for misspellings. The other great bit is that there are pretrained models\\* that can be loaded in and used. \n",

It was\\nsupposed that following the eleven mil\\nlion increase bet we \\'n June 26 and July 3.\\na decrease might be looked for as tthe\\nJuly s tllerr.ent per: d Is usually f dlotvt d\\nby a temporary contraction, but so far\\nfrom a, shrinkage the banks show a gain\\nof ton millions during the month ended\\nand If the movement of oth r heavy crop\\nyears are of any value In comparison\\nthe upward trend should continue for\\nk m thirty to sixty days yet.\\nThe business New York banks are do\\ning is not generally appreciated. Thtir >\\nreserve requirements are now *17,000,000 j\\nIn excess of all cash they reported on I\\nhand the corresponding we k one year\\nago. A deduction shows that while the\\nNational Union bank and Bank of Amer\\nica made Increases in loans of *18,503,030,\\nor a sum equivalent to the total loan\\nexpansion reported In the statement, the\\nlosses reported by others were made up\\nby gains in which no less than twenty\\nsix banks participated.\\nThe small increase In d posits In the\\nface of the olan expansion and the heavy\\nreceipts of Interior funds Is surprising,\\nbut it is perhaps a belated evidence of\\nheavy customs payments and withdraw\\nal of legal tender for gold export pur\\nposes last week. The banks have been\\nlosing heavily to the sub-treasury for\\nten days, the amount for the week Just\\nended having been In excess of *3,000,000.\\nThe decrease of *1,631,100 In legal tenders\\nIs thus accounted for.\\nA significant feature in connection\\nwith the flow of money to New York is\\nthe decliqe in domestic exchange at in\\nterior points. At Chicago, especially,\\nwhete the exchange has been ruling at\\nfrom 40 to 60 cents premium. New York |\\nfunds have fallen to 30 cent discount and\\na similar change is noted at other cen\\nters. This indicated a reflex movement\\nof money for crop purposes and means\\nals-. that the idle c ;sh in New York banks\\nwill be reduced either through demands\\nof interior banks or locally.

It was\\nsupposed that following the eleven mil\\nlion increase bet we \\'n June 26 and July 3.\\na decrease might be looked for as tthe\\nJuly s tllerr.ent per: d Is usually f dlotvt d\\nby a temporary contraction, but so far\\nfrom a, shrinkage the banks show a gain\\nof ton millions during the month ended\\nand If the movement of oth r heavy crop\\nyears are of any value In comparison\\nthe upward trend should continue for\\nk m thirty to sixty days yet.\\nThe business New York banks are do\\ning is not generally appreciated. Thtir >\\nreserve requirements are now *17,000,000 j\\nIn excess of all cash they reported on I\\nhand the corresponding we k one year\\nago. A deduction shows that while the\\nNational Union bank and Bank of Amer\\nica made Increases in loans of *18,503,030,\\nor a sum equivalent to the total loan\\nexpansion reported In the statement, the\\nlosses reported by others were made up\\nby gains in which no less than twenty\\nsix banks participated.\\nThe small increase In d posits In the\\nface of the olan expansion and the heavy\\nreceipts of Interior funds Is surprising,\\nbut it is perhaps a belated evidence of\\nheavy customs payments and withdraw\\nal of legal tender for gold export pur\\nposes last week. The banks have been\\nlosing heavily to the sub-treasury for\\nten days, the amount for the week Just\\nended having been In excess of *3,000,000.\\nThe decrease of *1,631,100 In legal tenders\\nIs thus accounted for.\\nA significant feature in connection\\nwith the flow of money to New York is\\nthe decliqe in domestic exchange at in\\nterior points. At Chicago, especially,\\nwhete the exchange has been ruling at\\nfrom 40 to 60 cents premium. New York |\\nfunds have fallen to 30 cent discount and\\na similar change is noted at other cen\\nters. This indicated a reflex movement\\nof money for crop purposes and means\\nals-. that the idle c ;sh in New York banks\\nwill be reduced either through demands\\nof interior banks or locally.

This- pi dense Is a bold falsehood\\nthat can nut deceive any honest minded\\nman.\\nlnt> Wilson tariff of 1894 was so rapidly\\nresisting the great extravagance of ex\\npenditure that has grown int.) a habit,\\nwith both political parties, that these\\nwho demanded a protective tariff, for the.\\npurpose of forcing Lhe prople to pay th m -\\nbounties, for polJiical err vie s render: d inâ\\x80\\x9d\\nthe campaign of 1896, created greit pr s\\nsure upon the senate to have itheir\"\\nplan of robbery enacted into law. In the\\nhouse, Mr. Reed held autocratic power\\nand could do the work.\\nIt would not have answered the purpose\\nto wait until a regular session of coir\\ngres3. because, by that time, it would\\nhave been undeniable that the Wilson\\ntariff wou-.d, with its comparatively low\\nTates, supply the tr asury with all ttrr\\nmoney that Is needed. So, haste had to\\nbe made to save their pretext from belt g\\nlost. A falsehood was needed to cimip.1\\nquick work, and it was found.\\nTo be sure of rapid action, Mr. Reed\\nWas called into service to pass the bill\\nwithout debate and then to attempt to\\nterrify the senate Into sp edy action by\\nexhibiting himseff aa a great example of\\npatriotic zeal, and the senate Â«s an ob\\nstruction to \"prosperity.â\\x80\\x9d To do this\\nand alarm the world with the sp ctacie.\\nof the discipline of his janazaries in the\\nhouse, he bolted the doors of the â\\x80\\x9cpopu\\nlar branch\" and muzzifd debate, when\\nthey wire pryed open by the mar date of\\nthe constitution, for a few minutes twice\\na week, as Turkish mosques are opened on\\nFriday\\'s for prayers.\\nThis vulgar and shameless usurpation\\nof power, on the did lines of republican\\nTide, was only useful to show that the\\nspeaker of \\'the house still has the power\"\\nto force his party back into the old ,1\\'rac- t\\ndice of \"addition, division and sller.ee.\\nIt also shows that the democracy have\\nno representatives in the house who are\\nwilling to sacrifice comfort and desirable\\nplaces on committees for the sake of de\\n, cency In government and stern antagon\\nism to despotism. From beginning to\\nend the extra session of cor.igrss was d -\\n_ voted to pressure by the house for the\\npurpose of providirg a fund. by taxation,\\ncalled \"protection to American Industry,â\\x80\\x9d\\nwith which to pay campaign debt- and to\\nprovide funds for other political cam\\npaigns in the future. For this the ma\\njority is responsible, but it had assistance\\nfrom a minority weakened by divisinn.\\n. The entire plan of this proceeding was\\n^framed with the distinct and avowe 1\\n- purpose on the part of the repub leans .oi.\\nproviding bounties for party services, to\\nb- raised by special taxation levied upon\\nepecial subjects of importation, or by\\nputting on the free list such articles as\\nwould Increase the bounty to preferred\\nclasses and by refusing to tax the incomes\\n..of the great trustsâ\\x80\\x94banditsâ\\x80\\x94who were\\nlicensed arid \"puotectedâ\\x80\\x9d in the robbery\\nof thin people.\\nAre these the â\\x80\\x9cwords of truth and so\\n_Jbrlety,â\\x80\\x9d or are they unjust accusations,\\nas to the motives and â\\x80\\x9cxaggerated state\\nments as to the actual enactments of\\nthis â\\x80\\x9cDingley bill?\"\\nT-t ought to be enough on this question\\nto say that no answer or denial was aâ\\x80\\x98\\ntompted In the senate to the frequent,\\nopen and defiant accusation that such\\nwas the purpose of tilt bill, and such was\\nthe effect of many of its provisions.\\nThis is not a measure of â\\x80\\x9ctariff re\\nform,â\\x80\\x9d but of total revolution In the prin\\nciples and purposes of tariff taxation.\\nIt is a bill to create boun.lesâ\\x80\\x94called\\nâ\\x80\\x9cprotection\"â\\x80\\x94for a rtain limited classes,\\nand to compel all consumers to pay these\\nb untie?.\\nThat It is distinctly such a measure Is\\nshown by the fact that, in a great major\\nity of Its items of taxation, the duty is\\nno high as, generally, to reduce and often\\nto prevent importatione.\\nVs :(eveui.! can only come from im\\nports, \\'Jo check or co prevent importa\\ntion, 1s, necessarily, to reduce the income\\nof the government.\\nBut every article thus excluded makes\\na place for tb â\\x80¢ sale of that article, or one\\nTike it. in our home market, by the do\\n, mtwtlc manufac urer. an advanced\\nprice. The insult, of course, is \\'the do\\nmestic manufacturer can raise his prices\\nâ\\x96\\xa0 up to the cost of production, with the\\n\" tariff rate added, all of which gÂ»e into\\nhis awn pocket, and none of it into the\\n(treasury of the Uni\\'ied States. But this\\nIs knowledge that even the least Informed\\nPo-s.es. in this revolutionary enactment\\n\\'<rho r publicans openly avow that this is\\ntheir purpose.

But legislation and in\\njustice have pievented this proper\\ngrowth.\\nI do not despair of the future of our\\ncountry, even in this war upon commerce\\nand this suicidal feasting upon the vital:*\\nof the earnings of our own people, but\\nI deplore the waste and poverty and\\n-suffering that this Dingley bill must\\nshoulder down upon the industrial\\nclasses.\\nIt Is not possible. In this letter, to do\\nmoreTthan illustrate\\' the spirit, purpc.se\\n-and effort jif th? entire scheme by point\\nIng.put a few of its leading features.\\n- If-revenrfb is what was needed, while\\nthe treasury grows with $236,000,000 of\\nIdle capital, a tax of 5 per cent, upon the\\n6,00^iartlel.s on the free list would have\\nproShced^Jt. More than half our im\\nport* come in free of duty. But this\\nIJpulJL have made the manufacturers pay\\na- very slight duty on their free raw ma\\nterial, and that was impossible, because\\nit would have been a little money, a very\\nlittle, out of their pockets. Revenue\\nwas riot what they wanted. They wanted\\nbounty to the manufacturing corpora\\ntions, with stock largely held in Europe,\\nand exemption from taxation of all bonds\\nand st.cks and th lr tr n fers, in favor of\\nthose classes who hide their vast for\\ntune\\'s In such securities for the purpose\\nof escaping taxation, state and federal.\\nOn this point the pioof is direct and\\npositive and it brand* the republican\\nparty and its leaders, Dingley and Reed,\\nespecially, as being the enemies of the\\nindustrial classes, and the guardians of\\nthe sugar trust and of ail the wealthy\\nmen and corporations, here and in Eu\\nrope, who hold the bonds and stocks of\\nincorporated capital. It Is a fearful ac\\ncusation. but It cannot be denied.\\nAfter the Dingley bill had been nearly\\ncompleted In the senate, Senator Lodge,\\nof Massachusetts, offered an amendment\\nto it. providing for a very light percent\\nage of revenue taxes on bonds and the\\ntransfers of stocks of incorporated com\\npanies. His leading purpose was to\\nreach the sugar trust with taxation.\\nThis amendment was approved by a re\\npublican caucus; was offered in the sen\\nate by Mr. Allison (republican), who had\\nehaige of the bill, and was voted, by the\\nsenate, unanimously as a feature of the\\nbill. It was prepared with great care\\nand was, for the most part, copied from\\na former statute of the United States.\\nWhen the blit went\\'to the committee of\\nconferepce, the . republican committee\\nmen, Trom the HoUfe, insisted on striking\\nout these taxes, the republican commit\\nteemen of the senate agreed to strike\\nthem-put, and U was dona, and the demft.\\nJimt 2\\',\\'f\\ncrats and populists were rot strong\\nenough to pass the amendment. It was\\ncru.-hed obt on the Anal vote on the bill.\\nThus, at least $9,000,000 of revenue was\\ngiven to the sugar trust in addition to\\nthe protectionâ\\x80\\x94called \\'\\'differential\"â\\x80\\x94\\ngiven that lordly monopoly ii this bill\\nas it passed both bodies.\\nWhile this tax was under dissmsion in\\nthe conference committee, the ris- in\\nsugar stocks was so rapid that the bulla\\nin Wall street made not less than $J0.\\nU00.000.\\nI charged, in the senate, that the aban\\ndonment of this just tax was caused by\\nthc direct influence of the sugar trust,\\nand no man disputed the fact.\\nThe price of sugar has gone up. as the\\nfirst immediate result of the protection\\ngiven to the sugar trust.\\nThis advance, and the whole mass of\\nthe stock boards, come out of the pedple\\nwho are ill prepared to sustain such op\\nprTSsfon.\\nThe conference committ e also struck\\nout of the bill the provision inserted on\\nthe motion of Senator Pettus, to put oot\\nton bagging and ties and jute bags, etc.,\\non the free list. JEhis was a dlr:et blow\\nat the â\\x80\\x98farmers ST the south and west,\\nintended to punish them for their votes\\nagainst .the enarmqtjs burdens of this\\nDingWy blit. *\\nThe democrats, who directly or ir.dl\\nrectlj?. agisted ffi the republican victory\\nof November, 1896, found themselves\\ntrodden under foot and despised by their\\nnew political associates, and so th-y\\nwill be to-theâ\\x80\\x98opd.- ^\\nTh, Dingley bill. In almost everj\\' Item\\nof \\'.he thousands of taxed articles, Is the\\nhighest, most ,-everc and moot unjust\\ntariff law that was ever tnaet\\' d by con\\ngress. and iâ\\x80\\x98. come upon (he people at a\\ntime when, of all othens in our history,\\ntk> y are least able to bear it.\\nThe na tonal banks may be willing to\\nforce a stimulated boom to aid this bill in\\nan apparent realization of the general\\nprosperity that has been predicted as its\\nresult, bui ifie relapse that is sure to fol\\nlow. as weakness follows excess in every\\ndebauch, will place the American people\\nin tlie power of the monopolists of truVt\\nbreednig taxation, and in the control of\\nfinance.\\nJu-Ua . equality and fair dealing have\\nbe n scouted a.nd abused, and such things\\ncannot be in our free, conr.huJiona 1 re\\npublic without exciting Indignation, and\\nwithout ertating a powerful reaction.\\nSome sound democrats preferred to suf\\nfer this great wrong to be don> quickly,\\nthat the relief from It might be hastened\\nby the votes of the people; but 1 preferred\\nto make battle against this great oppr s\\nsa ;; an every stage of its Insolent prog\\nress, believing that It is, in almost every\\nparagraph, an abuse of power that is ut\\nterly violative of the spirit of the^con^.i\\ntu; ion.\\nIt is, to me, an intolerable thought, that\\nthe power .to tax the people should, at the\\ndemand of monopoly-, and at the 1ns:!\\ngaitian of the wicked conspiracies that\\nLie tailed â\\x80\\x9ctrus.is,â\\x80\\x9d be used to destroy\\none gr at class of honest people, to enrich\\nthose who prey upon the producing\\nclasses.

W. Vaâ\\x80\\x9e July 31.â\\x80\\x94The mining\\nsituation in the Wheeling district today\\nwas as follows; About half of the force\\nwere at work in two mines and about\\nforty were at work at Elm Grove. Only\\ntwo men returned to work at Mounds\\nvllle and it is not likely the effort to re\\nsume there will be successful. Secre\\ntary Lewis, of the Ohio miners, addressed\\nthe Elm Grove strikers today. There\\nIs likely to be a clash between those who\\nreturned to work and those who stuck\\nto the strike. The Glendale company\\nposted notices that all who did not re\\nturn to work were discharged. This\\nbrought about half the force to terms.\\nThe situation at Dillonvale and Fair\\nmont remains practically the same as\\nyesterday. Judge Mason announced this\\nevening that the injunction granted at\\nthe solicitation of the operators was not\\npermanent. â\\x96\\xa0 The miners do not seem to\\ncare any-thlng about the injunction.\\nThe Ohio Valley Trades and Labor as\\nsembly has Issued a call for a mass meet\\ning of all citizens in sympathy- with the\\nstrikers for next Thursday- evening.\\nScottdale, Pa., July 31.â\\x80\\x94Scott Cum\\nmings. the leader of the non-union men,\\nbrought here by the Soottdale Iron and\\nSteel company to take the places of the\\nstrikers, was shot and Instantly killed\\ntonight In front of the Commercial hotel.\\nCummins and three companions, all non\\nunion men, encountered a number of\\nstrikers as they came out of the bar\\nroom, and a war of words ensued. Some\\none fired a revolver and a dozen shots\\nfollowed In quick succession. Cum\\nmings dropped dead with a bullet in his\\nright temple and his three companions\\nfled to the mill, hotly pursued by- an an\\ngry crowd.

These casus\\nare of no general interest.\\nThe special session of the court this\\nweek had to do with the most import\\nant features of the fight between the\\nI,\"UlsviIle and Nashvill? and the Plant\\nsystem and Mobile and Ohio railroad\\ncompanies, over local terminal facilities,\\nand the attention of all railroad officials\\nin this section was centered upon the\\nproceedings.\\nSeveral months ago the city of Mont\\ngomery abandoned a certain small paik\\non Tallapoosa stieet in favor of the Ala\\nbama Midland railway and the Belt Lina\\nrailway, the latLr reprts-ming the Mo\\nbile and Ohio, which is now building a\\nbranch line from Columbus, Miss., into\\nthis city. The park is situated directly\\nin front of the general offices of the Mid\\nland and near the site of the Mobile and\\nOhioâ\\x80\\x99s proposed freight depot.\\nThe use of the park for a line of tracks\\nwas absolutely necessary to the M b.Ie\\nand Ohio, if they were to carry out their\\nterminal plans in conjunction with the\\nMidland or Plant system and utilizr the\\nTallapoosa street property, the most\\nconvenient they could get for depot pur\\nposes.\\nAfter being impressed with the Idea\\nthat the immediate construction of the\\nMobile and Ohio depended upon the grant\\nof this park, among other concessions\\nthe council gave up the park.\\nTracks were laid over t\\'hi property, and\\nall went well lor a few days.

Briefly the\\nhistory is this:\\nLast January the city cotmc.ll of Mont\\ngomery gave the Alabama Midland the\\nright to use and occupy river street,\\nwhich adjoins the park secured by the\\nMobile and OhJo and Mid land for ter\\nminal tracks. The Midland began lay\\ning tracks on River street one night and\\nthe Louisville and Nashville stopped\\nthem with an Injunction, contingent that\\nupon an abandonment of River street by\\nthe municipality the Louisville and Nq^h\\nviHe, as an abutting proprrty owner, was\\nentitled to one-half the street.\\nThe city court dissolved the injunction\\nof the Louisville and Nashville; an ap\\npeal was taken and on Wednesday the\\nsupreme court affirmed the opinion of\\nthe lower court.\\nThursday the deerpe was modified; the\\njudgment of affirmance was Fet aside and\\nnow the case goes back to the city court\\nfor trial on proof.\\nAnd so it will be seen that the big ter\\nminal war between three great railroad\\nsystems Is not yet endpd.

When the party speaks it will\\nbe with it as it is now with it.\\nIt will be democratic and independ\\nent; as independent as it is democratic;\\nas democratic as 11 is independent.\\nAt this time, however, it is unneces\\nsary to talk polities. The building np\\nof our great Industrial interests and the\\ndevelopment of the material resources\\nof the finest rogion on the continent\\nare matters of such â\\x80\\x9cpith and mo\\nmentâ\\x80\\x9d that they Bhould occupy the\\npresent place in all thoughts.\\nThe mission of the Age-Herald is to\\nbuild upâ\\x80\\x94never to pull down. It will\\nstrive with its might to develop Bir\\nmingham and Alabama industrial!}-; it\\nwill protect the industries we have and\\nendeavor to extend them.\\nIt starts on its mission wiih its face\\nâ\\x80\\x9e to the sunrise, with hope in its heart\\nnnd with the determination to make\\nitself a potential factor in everything\\nthat concerns the welfare of its people.\\nThe .South has suffered less than any\\nother section from the prolonged finan\\ncial depression, and Birmingham and\\nAlabama are again forging their way to\\nthe front, with brighter prospacts than\\never, in spite of the unfavorable con\\nditions.\\nNow, more than ever Birmingham\\nneeds a first-class daily newspaper de\\nvoted to her interests and thoso of Ala\\nbama and the adjoining states. The\\nAge-Herald will exert itself to tho ut\\nmost to satisfactorily meet the require\\nments of the situation. Its owners feel\\nassuiod that the busy city- and the\\ngreat commonwealth for whose up\\nbuilding they are woiking, are about\\nto enter an era of great prosperity.\\nThe management feels confident that\\nthe public-spirited people of this city\\nand section will heartily encourage its\\nefforts on the line indicated, and it\\npledges itself to respond to their call\\nwhenever it can be of service.\\nToo many promises in advance some\\ntimes excite distrust. The Age-Herald\\nprefers to lot its future course speak for\\nitself. It is enough for the present, to\\n6ay that it will, at all times, be demo\\ncratic and independent; a faithful ex\\nponent of public opinion; an industri\\nous news-gatherer, an active worker\\nfor its people and a bright, fearless\\nchampion of popular rights.\\nWatch us, Hiid see how we carry out\\nthese pledges.\\n_ E.

Progress at first was slow\\nand expensive and but for the high range\\nof values of coal, eke and iron, it is\\nain Open question whether with the slen\\nder resources at the command of the\\npioneers of the Birmingham district\\nwould have allowed of the consumma\\ntion of the splendid triumph which has\\ncrowned the work so ably inaugurated\\nand skillfully pursued by them.\\nThe o*\\'St of pig iron, for example, made\\nin the Birmingham furnaces a few jeers\\nago, was more than twice the price it\\nwill bring In the markets of the world\\ntoday. New furnaces and a new fur\\nnace practice has enabled this district to\\nsell,pig iron at $G without losing money.\\nWe register the prediction, without\\nbeing technically accurate, that stee) bil\\nlets which may cost $12 at the outset, will\\nbe made at $10 in less than two years,\\nat d that Birmingham steel, like Birining\\nâ\\x80¢fesm plg\\' it\\'on, will sell in competition in\\nthe markets of England and the con\\ntinent.\\nOnly a part of the book of industrial\\ngenesis has boon written.

Master WJlliam Mitten, who was\\nruined bj- good luck.\\nCooper belongs to a leading family, and\\nis related to ex-Presldeni Tjler. He\\nis descended from fire old revolutionary\\nstock, and is a member of the Society of\\nCincinnati, an organization composed\\nof the mate descendants of Washingtonâ\\x80\\x99s\\nofficers.\\nHr came out of the late war with a\\ng. od confederate record, and the people\\nof Atlanta liked him so well that they\\nhave kept him ill office lâ\\x80\\x99or about thirty\\nyears. He has been clerk in tlie ordin\\nary\\'s office, mayor and cleric of the couu\\ntj\\' commissioners.\\nUnfortunately, Cooper began his official\\nlife at a time when careless methods\\nprevailed. He was a natural product of\\nhis sehO\"l, and when Atlanta became\\nmore sj-stemaiic he clung to his old ways.\\nVv\\'hj- should he account for public money\\nor make an entry on his books today,\\nhim. He used the countyâ\\x80\\x99s money\\nThis habit of procrastination ruined\\nruined him. He used the county\\'s money\\nat his pleasure, but always with the in\\ntention of replacing it.\\nWhen he went out of office he ad\\nmitted that he owed the county some\\nthing, and asked for time to straighten\\nhis accounts. Before he had paid the\\nmoney the grand jury indicted him for\\nembezzlement, and, though he made\\nthe payment later, he was tried, con\\nvicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of\\n$r,m> and stay in Jail thrte months. The\\ngovernor refused to knock off the Jail\\nsentence, and the former mayor of At\\nlanta will have to serve his term.\\nIt is a sad case. The man was guilty\\nof no intentional wrong. He\\'knew that he\\ncould replace the money he was using,\\nand he saw no harm in it. Everybody\\nseemed to like him, and the thought nev\\ner entered Ills head that anybody would\\ntr>\\' to disgrace \"Sod humiliate him.\\nOre morning he woke up to find that he\\nwas mistaken. He w&s singled out to\\nbe sacrificed on the altar of Justice. Sim\\nilar cases had been settled, but his was\\nto be made an exception. Even the gov\\nernor would not interfere. He had re\\nfunded every dollar, and was ready to\\npay his fine, but certain influential men\\ndemanded his humiliation, and he was\\nsent to jail.\\nThe case teaches more than one les\\nson. It should teach men never to\\nwrongfully use the money of others, and\\nnever to violate the law under the im\\npression that their political friends will\\nprotect them. A public official must\\nbe above suspicion if he would be safe.\\nSPAN IS H-A M*E RICAN TRADE.\\nBirmingham and Alabama should use\\ntheir best efforts to bring about the com\\npletion of tile proposed Nicaragua canal.\\nWith this -water route between the two\\noceans, many of the leading products of\\nAlabama would be shipped from Mobile\\nto every Spanish-American port on the\\nI Pacific, a* wsCl as the Atlantic, and they\\nwould also find ready sale In the Aelatio\\n, markets.\\nBut we need not wait fur the canal be\\n, fore we invite Spanish-American trade,\\ni It is not enough to send a few drummer*\\nV\\nInto the countries south cf us.

For this grave offense, this\\nreckless young couple have been tabooed\\nby all the swelldom of military posts, and\\ntheir lives made- miserable by endless snubs\\nand slights. In despair they have decided\\nto separate for awhile, Mrs. Long return\\ning to the parental roof, while her young\\nhusband assumes his former social position j\\nin military circles.\\nPerhaps it was this pitiful 9tory of the\\nLongsâ\\x80\\x99 infelicities that has been the in\\nspiration of the Atlanta Blue Book, which\\nwill appear early in the autumn.

One of those old\\nfashioned one-ring circus?-**, with a clown\\nof the Johnny Lamlow variety, was show\\ning. I went to it with a crowd of young\\npeople. We all sat on the top bench, eat\\ning peanuts and having a merry time.\\nJu3t in front of us sai two women. One\\nof them was of the ordinary type from\\nthe low country. The other was a prim\\nitive old maid. She was perhaps 55; she\\nwas tail, angular and diign-itt-d She had\\nevidently no: been to town before for\\nmany years. The sight of a man was\\nstrange to her. and from her appe-aranco\\nShe yet had aspirations for the marital\\nstate. She was prim. Curls which had\\nevidently be on carefully rolled around o\\nreod .he night before dangled over her\\nforehead from beneath the folds of a pone\\nbonnet. Upon her hands she wore old\\nfashion d block mits. She sat erect and\\nlooked straight before her into the ring.\\nThe performance had been going on for\\nsome time when the clown ambled n.\\nHe bore in hisâ\\x80\\x98hand a newspaper, and he\\nannounced with many flourishes that he\\nwould read a poem wrlt.en to him by he\\nable editor. With those foolish motions\\nwhich a clown indulges in to amuse the\\nchildren he pretended to be fax-sight- d.\\nHe held the pap-rat -arm\\'s length to read,\\ntout apparently that was not far enough\\nto suit his vision. Then he rested it\\nagainst the center polo of the tent and\\nproceeded to tack off until he got to ho\\nedg1 of the ring. Still his point of vision\\nwas not satt.-fled. He thought a moment.\\nA bright idea seemed to 3trike him. Suit\\ning the idea to .\\'he moment he rushed to\\nthe paper, spread it upon the sawdust\\nand \\'then folded n gr at horse blanket\\nmany times over until it was fully a foot\\nin thickness. He laid this over the paper.\\nThen looking Into the \\'blan-ke\\', he pre\\ntended to be -able \";o read the print and\\nproceeded to recite his poem.\\nTh.? old maid, who sat in front of us,\\nlook-d upon the elew-n In perfect amaze\\nment. She then turned and looked at us\\nIn apparent horror. She blustered and\\ngathered herseif clos*? to her companion.\\nThen she stood up and, turning to her\\ncompandem said:\\nâ\\x80\\x9cMary, if that there clown can read\\nthat there paper through that there\\nblanket then these clothes Iâ\\x80\\x99ve got om\\nain\\'t no protection to me, and I think I\\nhad better goâ\\x80\\x9d\\nAnd with these remarks she scurried\\nover the seats holding h*T shawl and\\nother objects between hers-df and Iho\\nclown until She disappeared from the\\ntent.\\nÂ« * â\\x80¢\\nHam.

John was no ac\\ncount, he wouldnâ\\x80\\x99t work, but layed\\naround the house and c nsumed what his\\nindustrious wife and his boys and girls\\nmud? on a little farm.

The fluctua\\ntions have been narrow and the net change\\nin prices insignificant. Today, in the ab\\nsence of any Liverpool advices, the mar\\nket \\\\vas almost dead. The Chronicle\\'** re\\nport on the crop was rather good. In the\\nlast half* hour the execution of a lew buyâ\\x80\\x94<\\ning orders stiffened prices a little. Janu\\nary opened at 7.08, advanced to 7.12 and\\np Closed at 7.12 to 7.13. with the tono of the\\nmarket steady. Crop developments during *\\nthe week have been of a favorable charac\\nter. The bulls contend that a largo area\\ni In Texas still needs moisture, lait therev\\nhave boon some good rains in the state ,\\nâ\\x80¢d and they have been of undoubted benefit\\nwhore had. In spite of this, such advan\\nJM tago as there has been In the trading rests\\nupon the banners of the bulls. The result |\\nri Is duo to continued confidence in the gen- :\\neral outlook, to a notable improvement in !\\nV* the market for cotton goods, to the gooi !\\ndemand for spots, and lastly, to the j\\nb strength of August contracts. The latter\\n. feature occasioning such conjecture con\\ncerning the existence of a \"deal,.â\\x80\\x99 we hard\\nly .think the shorts are numerous to make\\nmake manipulation worth the while, but\\ni , the short interest may be larger than wo\\nthink, and if it is a big one, an upward\\nmovement of that month is almost certain.\\nWe think it unwise to trade in August\\n^ either way. Those who expect higher\\nprices are confident. They place great\\nhopes unon the knowledge that the south\\nwill be overrun with cotton buyers ready\\nb to rnap up early receipts at possibly fancy\\nprices. Wo think, howrever, that most\\n( . every seller is holding off until the critical\\nperiod of the new crop. If this demand is\\nat its best, we believe that those who want\\ncotton will then find themselves supplied\\nwithout any great upheaval In its price.\\nRIORDAN & CO.\\nChioaaro \\'Change\\nChicago, July 31.â\\x80\\x94The July deal fn wheat\\nexpired gently today at 75ftc.

The*\\nLondon stock exchange being closÂ« d today,\\nas well as Monday, arbitrage brokers did\\n. nothing in this market. Northern Pacific\\nsecurities continued in heavv demand, with\\nthe preferred rising 1%, it being largely\\n. bought by a house regarded as represent\\ning important speculative interests Sugar\\nwas quiet and the Grangers and Soutb\\nwosterns rather lagged. Kornâ\\x80¢? room traders\\nsold Grangers because of the slackened\\ndemand for those shares on vague stories\\nof damage. The total sales of stocks todav\\namounted to 162,690 shares, including Ches\\napeake and Ohio, 16,525; Northern Pacific,\\n13,804: Northern Pacific preferred, 87,655; St.\\n.Paul, 9,700; Chicago Gas, 5,200; Colorado\\nF. & l. preferred, 11,116; Quicksilver, 9,\\n0(>o; Chicago Great Western, 6.006.\\nTiie stock market had advanced sc long,\\npartly in anticipation of a sett foment of\\nthe tariff, that the enactment thereof had\\nno appreciable effect at the beginning of\\nthe w*â\\x80\\x98**k. Stocks were irregular, but many\\nadvances were made on a constant increase\\nin public interest, a rise of over 4c in the\\nprice of wheat and the enormous dailv\\nmovement, nearly 1.000,000, of wheat en\\ngaged for export, decreases in imports,\\nand commercial agenciesâ\\x80\\x99 reviews showing\\nincreased business with western Jobbers â\\x80\\x9c\\ncompared with last year, and that nearlv\\nevery northern city reported improvement\\nin business. The total transactions for the\\nweek were in bonds, the largest cf tlie past\\ntwo years at advancing prices. Unfavora\\nble features were the lagging of tlie iron\\nmark, t noted elsewhere, and the closing of\\nmany cotton mills, ami especially the ex\\nport of $4,000,000 in gold.\\nGovernment bonds reflected the public\\nconfidence in business, while stocks and\\nbbnds long neglected were active of higher\\nfeatures, notably those of southern and\\nwonthwestern railways, owing ic improved\\ncrop elements and increased traffic. Al\\ntogether tiie market was broad and ma.ny\\ntop prbv<s were noted. Railwav earnings\\nboth net.and gross, were generally pleas\\ning. regardless of the existence of the -\\ngreat bituminous coal strike.\\nThe scope of the market was appreciably\\nextended on Wednesday, and a brisk pur=_\\nftnajdtig movement, embracing an exten\\nsive variety of shares, ensued. Tiie prom\\ninence of certain shares gave rise to reports\\nthat u powerful interest was operating to\\nenhance values. This received some cre\\ndence and stimulated heavy covering by\\nthe shorts. Late crop advices were more\\nreassuring. Rumors of a possible resump\\ntion of dividends on certain internationally\\nlir-ted properties caused London to repur\\nchase heavily of foreign favorites and take\\nround amounts of speculative mortgagee. â\\x80\\x99\\nThe anthracitic coalers moved spasmodical\\nly, but displayed considerable strength on\\nrevived reports of impending deals and ex\\ncellent. trade prospects. Local gas shares\\nsharply advanced on oft-repeated rumor\\nns to tho impending consolidation of lend\\ning companies, which lacked verification\\nfrom official sources. The feature of the\\nsilver market was the fall of bar to 26 1-5\\nIn London on Wednesday and a corre\\nsponding fall to 57ft here, with Mexican\\ndollars down to 45c, all low-priced records\\nfor the white metal. On covering of short\\nin London there was a partial recovery in\\n, tjie silver market, which subsequently\\nslumped, dosing 57fto for bars and Infto for\\n.^Mexican dollars.\\nâ\\x80\\x98 Money on rail was loaned generally at 5\\ni per cent, with some few transactions at\\nt1:. .and small amounts at 2 per cent.\\nThe supply of time money exceeded the\\ndemand, but the transactions reported\\nwere at unchanged quotations. The ster\\nling exchange market was strong, and war\\nranted the shipment of_about $1,600,000 gold,\\na. portion of which was covered by sales\\nof bonds at the opening. There was an\\nexport of $100,000 of gold to Canada. The\\ncontinent continues disposed to import\\ngold, which goes largely into the Rank of\\nFrance. Actual business in bankersâ\\x80\\x99 bills\\nclosed at $i.v7% for demand, $4.86 for sixty\\nday*.

NUMBER 167\\nDILEMMA OFM OLD MAN\\nWho Got Into the Toils of Prac\\ntical Jokers\\nAND A LOVELY YOUNG LADY\\nAn Alabamian Who Beat tho Groan Goods Men\\nbut Finally Was Bettered by Bul\\nlets from Ambush.\\nA secret service man, a fun-loving\\ndrummer and an old gentleman who has\\ngrown gray as a traveling man, were the\\nactors in an episyde the other night that\\nfurnished oodles of fun for the first two\\nand much embarrassment for the latter.\\nThe story opens with the old gentle\\nman walking down one of Birmingham\\'s\\nprincipal thoroughfares. Smiling into\\nâ\\x80¢his face was a bewitching little bru\\nnette.\\nThe old gentl;iman whispered those lit\\ntle witticisms, peculiar to th aged lover,\\nand everything was as promising as the\\ngold prospects in the Klondyke regions.\\nSuddenly the old gentleman was fill d\\nwith mysterious forebodings, the sweet!\\nsmile was no longer charming and the\\n\"chit chat\" was not so much like the\\nlover\\'s music of his halcyon days. The\\nsecret service man was his Nemesis, fol\\n1 v.ing close at his heels. In reality the\\nâ\\x80\\x9csecret serviceâ\\x80\\x9d man thought nothing\\nof the old chap, merely making a mental\\nobservation of the beauty of his com\\npanion.\\nWhen the government officer reached\\nthe hotel the first one to greet him was\\nthe aged lover. He nervously li tr due d\\nhims lf, flipper was taken together and\\nthe pair became better acquainted. S.^me\\nthing weighed on tho old manâ\\x80\\x99s mind\\nand he unbundled it with little cere\\nmony.\\n\"Are you a detective?â\\x80\\x9d he inquired.\\n\"Why, no,â\\x80\\x9d answered the gentleman,\\nwith a merry twinkle that showed fun\\nwas brewing.\\nThe old gentleman seemed relieved as\\nhe said: \"1 thought sure you were a de\\ntective in the employ of my wife, when\\nI saw you following me this afternoon.\\nShe is suspicious of me and I thought\\nthis was onetime 1 had been caught red\\nhanded.â\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x80\\x9cWeil, sinceil have come to think about\\nIt,â\\x80\\x9d said the secret service man, â\\x80\\x9c1 be\\nlieve there is a detective stopping here.\\nThe old gentlemanâ\\x80\\x99s ease of mind was\\nshort-lived and to make the matter worse\\ntho fun-loving drummer came along and\\nwas introduced. The old gentleman\\nwas taken aside and told this was the\\nsupposed detective.\\nHe grew frantic and resolved to leave\\ntown at once. A train was due in a\\nshort while and he made preparations.\\nImagine his chagrin on reaching the de\\npot to find the fake detective on deck.\\nHe called tho secret service man aside\\nand offered him a reward to get Hie de\\ntective off flic scent. Further develop\\nments showed that his shadow was to\\nleave on the same trtiln.\\nIt was a. show to eee the old gentleman\\nsneaking around his supposed pursuer.\\nHa scrambled aboard on the wrong side\\nand five minutes later the full-loving\\ndrummer took a train going in the op\\nposite direction.\\n* * *\\n\"Tlvre is a cute citizen down in the\\nbackwoods of Mississippi, who surpasses\\nmany of the slick city crooks we have\\nto deal With,â\\x80\\x9d s:\\\\ l a postoffice inspector\\nwho was lounging Around (the hotel. For\\nyears he worked such firms as the Doug\\nlass Shoe company and other northern\\nes\\'aiMishments without being det cted.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\"What\\'s his game?â\\x80\\x9d someone asked.\\n.\"Well,\" continued the inspector, â\\x80\\x98Tie\\nmerely writes a letter to gone firm re\\nquesting them to send him a catalogue.\\nThe only thing out of the ordinary Is that\\nhe registers this letltcr. Nothing more\\ntranspires until several monklts go by.\\nThen the country crook stis down and\\nproceeds to wrlite the firm a very vvrathy\\nletter, citing tht fatit that he sent, them\\nu registered letter on a certain date, con\\ntaining a certain amount for a bill of\\ngoods, which, so far, had failed to ar\\nrive.\\n\"The proprietor looks up his records\\nand finds a regtsoered letter wa3 \\'re\\nceived on the date named. He suspects\\nsome crookedness on the part of his em\\nployes and the order Is shipped out. The\\ncountry crook disposes of the stuff at the\\nbest profit possible and is just that much\\nin.\\n\"The way Jhis fellow was first appre\\nhended was through his partner. He hit\\nupon a r.ew scheme that, so he told his\\npartner, inquired a small outlay of cash.\\nBoth put up $15 and the total of $30 had\\nto be sent away in a regis:ered letter,\\na.-~ the more unwary jay was made to be\\nlieve. The slick artist prepared two en\\nvelopes just alike. The victim put the\\nbank notes into one envelope. The other\\none then said he would mail he letter,\\nlleput\\'llt ini his pocket. Then he sudden\\nly dlianged Ids rmlr.id and asked his vic\\ntim to have the letter registered. The\\npoor old jay stalked into the pustoffieo\\nand registered a loiter without a cem: in\\nIt, to some imaginary parties.\"\\n\"Speaking of confidence games reminds\\nme of the thrilling experience of Jim\\nHatley, a man who was well known in\\nLimestone county, with the green goods\\nswindlers of New York,â\\x80\\x9d remarked a g n\\ntleman who had been listening to the\\nstory about the Mississippi jay.\\n\"It has been almost ten years since\\nJirn. with a pall, whose name I do not\\nremember, received some of the aceus\\ntomary typewritten letters from New\\nYork .green goods swindlers. Jim was\\njust daring and reckless enough to be\\nlieve he could outwit anyb dy. Ac\\ncordingly he and his pal arranged a dat<3\\nfor meeting the New Yorkers. Dr rs d 1\\nas typical settlers front the most intense\\nly rural districts, Jim and his partner\\nbought tickets for New York. Th-:y\"\\nwere armed with $500 fv.e which il, y 1\\n^vere promised $5,090 of kn article that\\ncould not be detected from that coining\\nfresh front the mint. They Were also\\nprepared for any kind of difficulty.\\n\"On arriving In N#w York, they were\\nI\\nmet ar.d piloted to the \"bossesâ\\x80\\x99 denâ\\x80\\x9d Just\\nas have been pictured in the 10-ccnt nov- â\\x96\\xa0\\nels. The $5,000 was put in a valise for\\nthem and they hinted that they were\\nready to depart. The game of the\\nswindlers was to exchange a worthless\\nvalise for the one containing the booty\\nand, of course, they protested against\\nsuch a hasty departure. Jim and his pal\\ninsist\\' d and a general row ensued, dar\\ning which Jim backed himself cut of the\\nroom with drawn revolver and b fore\\nmany hours was speeding back to Ala\\nbama.\\n\"The other fellowT fared worse and was\\ntaken in tow by the police on a charge !\\nof carrying concealed weapons. He got\\noff, however, and so n joined Jim. Short\\nly afterwards he was cut to pieces in a\\nfight at a country dance fr\"m the effects\\nof which he died.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cJim for several years before his end\\nlived a peaceful life, managing the farm\\naffairs of Hon. John M. Hundley, near\\nMooreâ\\x80\\x99s mill in Limestone county.

The com\\nmittee delayed action for several years,\\nin the expectation that a constitutional\\nconvention would be held which could\\ndeal more satisfactorily with all ques\\ntions concerning the judiciary. The\\nproposition to have such a convention,\\nhowever, has been voted down by the\\npeople, and the committee has made a\\nreport prepared by Mr. J. C.

Vir\\nginia now pays the judges and clerks of\\nher courts of record and her prosecuting\\nattorneys an aggregate of $248,500 per\\nannum. The changes advocated by Mr.\\nParker In his report would reduce these\\nfigures to $143,500. thus saving $105,000 a\\nyear, and giving the people, as he con\\ntends, a better service with better paid\\nofficers.\\nIN DIG NAN tTrO JAN S\\nIn Mass Meeting Assembled Adopt Resolu\\ntions Recommending Speedy Trial of\\nCriminals of the Higher Type.\\nTroy, Ala., July 31.â\\x80\\x94(Spec\\'.nl.)â\\x80\\x94\\'The\\npeople of Montlcello, inc n-ed at the re\\ncent crimes, held a mass meeting Thurs\\nday and adopted resolutions demanding\\nâ\\x80\\x9cof our courts, juries and lawyers the\\nawiti and specify punishment to the full\\ncxter.\\'t of the law of ati criminals, and es\\npecially of the higher type of crimes.\\n\"IVe-demand of our Inferior courts the\\nprompt quest and punishment of all va\\ngrants and other suspicions characters.\\'1\\nSOME mm STORIES,!\\nBushwhacker John Used Weap\\nons Carnal and Spiritual.\\nCASE OF LOVERSâ\\x80\\x99 BLINDNESS\\nA Peep Into the Plantation Negro Quartersâ\\x80\\x94A\\nWake Without a Tuneralâ\\x80\\x94Strange\\nSuperstition About\\nLightning.\\nSpeaking of thi grin-play in the colored\\nBaptist congress a\\': \\'Montgomery that re\\nsulted iln the death, \\'before \\'.he altar, of\\nthe li\\'firo, p.

All th se elements exc.pt\\nthe carbon are Injurious to steel and their !\\npresence in the steel would make it\\nworthless by reason of brittleness.

Your railway\\nmanager keeps his fingers cm th?- public\\nwrist and looks Into its trade mouth every\\nhour of the day every day In the year. The\\nfingers of a railroad management are the\\nsoliciting and commercial agents. These\\nfingers are always outstretched, ready to\\nclose around any business which they can\\nhold.

The Ala\\nbama Great Southern lost $28,546 in gross\\ni earnings for the year, but gained $1,624 in\\nits net.\\nSo\" the statistics show that the trans\\nportation companies just about held their\\nown. So far as I have seen, no southern\\nrail line either made or lost much money\\nduring the past fiscal year. Now the man\\nagers are feeling better over the prospect\\nof a year coming in which they can partly\\nrecoup their past losses. The Indications\\nare that they will get an Increased vol\\nume of traffic. But will they make any\\nmore money out of It? That depends part\\nly on the roads themselves and partly on\\nthe rttte-making powers over which they\\nhave n-o control. In Georgia and the Caro\\nlines agitators are trying to have the\\nrates reduced by the commissions. It Is\\nsignificant that these movements against\\nthe earnings spring from politicians and\\nj others who have an income contingent\\nupon a warfare against the roads. In\\nNorth .Carolina, the fight recently made\\nwas notoriously prompted by the politi\\ncians. In South Carolina, there is po4i- j\\ntics behind much of the agitation, and in\\nGeorgia there is some politics and some\\nother things. The Georgia commission will\\ntake up next Wednesday an application\\nfor a reduction of 25 per cent in cotton\\nrates. The head pushers in the agitation\\nare neither farmers nor consumers. They j\\nare not gven shippers of cotton, and so far !\\nas I know they never were. The middle\\nmen are giving the movement what hack\\ning it has. Lost spring an application\\nwas. made for a general reduction of all\\nrates in Georgia, and the hostility which\\ndeveloped broke off a deal which was o<n\\nfor the purchase of a railroad by Nc*w\\nYork capitalists who had plans for invest\\ning a large sum of money in the state.\\nThey looked into the situation and became\\nalarmed.

Every\\nwhere he goes he is met with the objection\\nthat the commissions or the legisla\\ntures are liable to do something which\\nwill hurt a railroad investment. This has\\nnot been the disposition of the commis\\nsionsâ\\x80\\x94certainly not of lateâ\\x80\\x94but the con\\ntinual warfare on the roads deters local\\ninvestments, and if the home people will\\nnot subscribe for a new line through vir\\ngin territory, it cannot be expected that\\nNew York or foreign capital will take hold\\nof such a project. The people as a mass\\nare not hostile to tlw roads, but there are\\nalways some individuals who hope to profit\\nby the agitation for lower rates or greater\\nrestrictions on transportation lines.\\nMore Tonnage, Less Profits.\\nThey do no* take into account the fact\\nthat natural competition is steadily bring\\ning rates down. It is a fact .that while\\nthe railroads of tho United States are\\nhandling a larger tonnage than â\\x80\\x99they did a\\nfew years ago, they are making less money.\\nThey are in the position of a I merchant\\nwho does one-third more business, but\\nmakes less money on it year after y^ar.\\nIn 1895 the income of all the railroads in\\nthe United States fell \\'off $50,000,000 fi^om\\nthe year before. In 1896 they lost $50,601000\\nmore. There was a decrease of $l00,0o),000\\nin .two years. In 1S88 the railroads of the\\ncountry averaged 1 cent per ton for mile\\nfor freight. A drayman would charge from\\n50 cents to $1 for hauling a ton a mile. In\\nUP) the roods received only 8 2-5 mills for\\nhauling a ton a mile.

On a basic of\\n$45,COO a mile, there would be dividends for\\nall the roads up there, but if our roads\\nwere capitalized at $120,000 a mile, there\\nwould be no dividends for any, and not\\neven all the bonds would pay interest.\\nWe hear aj great deal about our railroads\\nbeing ov*r capitalized.

One of the railroads against\\nwhich this charge is made is the Central\\nRailway of Georgia, which penetrates Ala\\nbama. This system is capitalized at $33,\\n333 per mile in round numbers. Of this,\\nper mile is a funded debt, on which\\nit has lo pay interest or go Into a receiver\\nship. Well, it Is just making that interest,\\nand neither the Income* bonds nor the com\\nmon stock is paying a cent. Could the\\nCentral be replaced for $50,000,000? Well,\\nhaia.y. 1 heaid Jay Gould say once, after\\nlooking over the system, that its wharves\\nalone at Savannah were worth $7,000,000.\\nThen figure in the terminals at Birming\\nham, Columbus, Atlanta, Macon, Augusta\\nand the other cities which it touches, and\\ncount the tracks, equipment and fran\\nchises.\\nTake the Southern railway, and we find\\nthat its average bonded debt is about $19,\\n000 per mile in Georgia and Alabama. The\\naverage bonded debt of all reads in the\\nUnited States is $31,048 per mile, and the\\naverage in the Alabama group is $23,153\\nper mile. Certainly no on? will maintain\\nthat the Southernâ\\x80\\x99s lines in Alabahia, with\\ntheir terminals, rights of way, franchises\\nand equipment could be replaced for $19,\\n000 per mile or for anything like that sum.\\nThe same mileage now- operated by the\\nSouthern svsteni earned $290,000 more in\\nV.m than in IS.%- This was a loss of 11 per\\ncent in gross earnings, despite the fact\\nthat the system handled 3 per cent more\\nbusiness in 189Â© than in 1891. There was a\\nloss of 15 per cent in net earnings between\\n1891 and 1890, and the percentage of loss\\nwas greater for the year ending June 30,\\n1897. The average rate per ton per mile\\non the Southern railway system In 1891 was\\n1U cents, or 11G mills. In 1896 it was one\\nmill and a half lower, or a decline of 13.G\\nper cent in five years. The Southern is. not\\npaying a cent of interest on its stock, but\\nthe stockholders have paid an assessment\\nof $10 a share out of their own pockets into\\nthe treasury.\\nRates are falling all the time through\\nthe forces of natural competition, and they\\nare falling so rapidly that the time is com\\ning when all the roads will be in receiver\\nships again unless this downward ten\\ndency can be* arrested.\\nLast year the Southern railway paid\\n$584,061 taxes in eight states.

They are just making ex\\npenses and interest on their bonds. They\\nhave the lowest rates now in the world,\\nconsidering the population along their line.\\nThe North Carolina commission refused to\\nreduce cotton rates because the roads\\ncould not stand a loss in revenue. No\\nmore can the roads in Georgia stand a re\\nduction in rates on cotton. And It happens\\nthat the North Carolina rates are almost\\nidentically the same as the Georgia rates.\\nIf the commissions protect the roads,\\nâ\\x80¢they will be able to get along very well\\nthe coming year, If they do not get to\\nfighting among themselves. Every road Is\\na free lance now. There are no agree\\nments to maintain rates, and if one road\\ngoes to cutting the others have to follow\\nsuit in self defense. They have a situation\\nto face among themselves. The managers\\nrealize its gravity and are trying to Im\\npress upon each other the necessity for\\nconservative methods. General demoraliza\\ntion would be as ruinous as an order from\\nthe commissions to reduce rates. In a\\nwar. the small or weak lines usually got\\nthe bos* of it for a time, at least. If the\\ncutting gets deep, the little fellows cannot\\nstand a loss so long as the larger systems\\ncan stand it, but they manage to pick up\\na good many dollars in one way or another\\nwhich otherwise they would never get their\\nhands on.\\nThe leading managers of southern rail\\nroad properties Fay that rates will b? sta\\nble. and that if the commissions will not\\noppress them, they will be able to pull\\nthrough another year in satisfactory shape.\\nAll thev aÂ»k is to be allowed to shareâ\\x80\\x99in th.*\\nhotter times along with the farmers, mer\\nchants and manufacturers. â\\x80\\x98\\nTheir prayer to the commissions is like\\nthe one* put up by the man who was fight\\ning the bear â\\x80\\x9cOh.

Odell, of the committee on\\naccounts of the house, is greatly di--saL\\nisfied with the bill submitted by the un\\ndertaker Who had charge of t\\'he funeral\\nof the late Congressman, Cook, of Illi\\nnois. This undertaker asks the house of\\nrepresentatives to pay him $1,250.\\nMr. Odell claims that many of the\\nItems of the bill are oxhoibitant, and al\\ntogether out of proportion to the value\\ncf the services rendered and the material\\nfurnished. He particularly objects to\\nthe charge of $50 for embalming the re\\nmains, which he declares is thro? itlmes\\nas much as undertakers usually aek In\\nNew York. The charge of $350 for the\\ncasket anid cases Is another which he\\nthinks altogether too great. Then, itoo,\\nthe funeral director asks $15 for tb\\' throe\\ndays he was engaged In traveling be\\ntween here and Chicago, which Mr. Odell\\nsays is more than his own salary as a\\ncongressman for \\'the same time, and he\\ndoes not believe that the services of an\\nundertaker are more valuable than\\nthose of a representative. He wants the\\nbill cut at least $200 before he will con\\nsent to recommend Its payment. But\\nthe undertaker Is unwilling to cut it at\\nall. \\'\\nMr. Odell points out that his commit\\ntee has Just authorized the payment of\\nthe funeral expenses of one of the\\' em\\nployes of the house, who died about \\'the\\nsame time, the cost of whose funeral\\nwas only about $148. He fails to see\\nwhy there should be a difference of $1000\\nbetween the expense of hurying a repre\\nsentative and an employe of the house.\\nâ\\x80\\x94Washington Post. _\\nA CONGRESS OF YOUNG BLOOD.\\nNever in the history of the country have\\nthen been iso many young men ehe.s m as\\nrepresentatives of \\'.he people in congress\\nos were elected to the present house. .It is\\nemphatically a congress of young men,\\nas ehe most casual observer from the gal\\nlet Its will readily note.

A London book seller facetlou-dy\\nexclaims, \"The number of r.ew books and\\nnew editions is as great as ever. What\\na trade would be done If each one Justifi d\\nIts existence! Some one has suggested\\na tax upon new books for keeping down\\nthe number.\"\\nMiscellaneous subjects are ab;ut equal\\nly divided as to lb? number of titles, but\\nthe sales of the former far exceed those of\\nthe latter. It is possibly Just what we\\nmight expect that fiction should be in\\ngreater favor during the sultry summer\\ndays, when the utmost one can demand\\nof his energies is to lie In a hammock,\\nswunk in some shady nook, with a book\\n-which will only require a small expendi\\nture of grey-matter for its perusal. In\\nshort, amusement, entertainment, is all\\nthat even the most persistent and strenu\\nous stud-erJt can claim at this time of\\nyear. However, onte can inquire with the\\ncritic\\'s usual anxious supervision in such\\nmatters, what \\'kind\\' of fiction does he\\nread? There are two sides to this per\\ntir.er.it question of the reading of fiction.\\nIn the July number of the Homiletic\\nReview th: editor enters into a d squbl\\ntion on moJern degt : eracy and cornea\\nvery treat- declaring that the supposed\\ncorruption of the body politic Is du â\\x80¢ to\\ninordinate navel reading, helped along by\\nÂ©eneatlonal journalism.

In addition to this tirst\\nj essential of the successful novelist, it fol\\nlows that the relation of this Btory in\\n| eludes many interesting events, and the\\nportrayal of widely diverge It personag s\\nand scenes. He dreams with equal! skill\\nthe greatest and th* least. Proud, con\\nceited, self-willed Nero, luxurious and\\nflattered amidst thu pomp and withering\\ngayety and licentiousness of his imperial\\ncourt his nobles, the Augusta Poppaa,\\nor.d women are drawn with accuracy and\\npresented to the mind of the readier with,\\nsuch broad, local coloring that they ap\\npear to be flesh ard blood and the ener\\nvating mists of such feasts and luxury\\nseems to issue from every page entering\\nthe mind and heart Of the reader.

In the\\nhomes of tlv nobles we seem to learn asi\\nif by actual personal contact \\'the state\\nand abject servitude of the tCaves, whose\\n; sole ambition in life was his master\\'s\\nI whirrs and wishes.

To be sound in body and mind\\nis the greatest boon that can be bestow\\ned upon the human family. Any other\\ncondition makes life a burden and not\\nworth living. No wealth that this world\\ncan off-r will compensate for the loes of\\nhealth. There are those with their mil\\nlions who would gladly give it all away\\nin order to enjoy once more the happi\\nness that health alone can give.

Indeed,\\nthat the whole board of lady managers\\nwishes brought before the public and\\nemphasized, is that th amount of char\\nity work done in the Hillman hospital Is\\nmuch greater in proportion to the funds\\nof the institution than that done in any\\nsimilar hospital in any city, be It wh re\\nIt may.\\nAbsolutely the only means of defray\\ning th\" exp nse of caring for the char\\nily patients, Is the Hillman fund of .\\n2(XH-$SM each month.\\nIn oMer to increase the usafqlnea* of\\nthe work d*>nÂ» here, there la a provtaton\\nfor as many as sixteen pay patient*.\\nA fact pointed out to me by Mrs. Hum\\nphreys, the nurse In charge of operation*,\\nla that charity patients are as well if\\nnot better cared for than those In the\\npay ward. Patients themselves reiter\\nate this Important fact, and seem so\\ndeeply to appreciate the kindly treat\\nment accorded them, that at the expira\\ntion of their convalescence, they are re\\nluctant to leave such pleasant quarters.\\nTo illustrate the foregoing, a story was\\ntold me by the nurse of a gentleman who\\nhas recently recovered from a severe sur\\ngical operation. He had been discharged\\nby Dr. Copeland and his wife sent for\\nhim yesterday. However, she simply\\nsent her carriage in charge of the driver.\\nHe soon returned as he went- -minus the\\npatient.

His assistants are Dr. R. A. Berry,\\nhis professional ass\"ciate; Dr. J.

The truth of the state\\nment of the stay-at-home In answer to\\nthe queries of the frequent visitor sug\\ngested a first-class opportunity for a bit\\nof Insight into the unfortunate element\\nwhich pervades the streets and avenues\\nof the city daily.\\nNaples is celebrat-d for its thousands\\nof mendicants. Florence, her sister city,\\nIs by no means lacking in them. Jto\\nfairer cities adorn the Eastern conti\\nnent, yet the presrnce of hundreds and\\n\\'thousands of vagabonds, beggars and\\nunforturates on the principal thorough\\nfares of the cities but serve to dim the\\nâ\\x96\\xa0lustre, and the blot grows instead of di\\nminishing the more one sees of them.\\nBirmingham has her share of mendi\\ncants, and they are here to stay. There\\nare all kinds of mendicants, old and\\nyoung, male and female, white and\\nblack, some of \\'them unsightly while oth\\ners of the unfortunatesare not uncom-iy\\nto look upon. There was a time when\\nthere were to be seen on the streets and\\navenues of this city d form d persons l\\nwhose very presence would cause men to\\nshudder, and women to fall ill, and yet\\nthey were allowed to roam without mo\\nlestation. Thes-, fortunately, have dis\\nappeared. Now for a word or two about\\nthose to be seen daily in shis city.\\nThe Legles* Fiddler.\\nFirst, is the legless fiddler. His name\\nIs Hiram Weidman. A few years ago\\nhe was an able-bodi d man and made a\\ngood living for his family. An evil day\\ncame and he was picked up at the rail\\nroad crossing a maimed and crippled\\nman. After the physicians and surgeons\\nhad finished with him he was minus\\nboth legs and a erippl for life.\\nHe- disapp ared from the streets of the\\ncity for >a time, and reappeared in an\\nInvalid\\'s chair with a fiddle and bow in\\nhand. He had been transformed from a\\nworkman fco a Iflddler. I While minus\\nboth lower limbs, he was not unsightly,\\nand when he would tune up his lidtlle,\\nrosin his bow and with his best ablltty\\ndraw from the strings old, familiar\\ntunes the nickels would rattle in Ills\\nlittle tin box. No matter if he did a\\nland office business or made a water\\nhaul, he never was seen to change eoun\\nleninoe. *\\n\"Howâ\\x80\\x99s business, Mr. Weidman?â\\x80\\x9d asked\\nthe reporter, as the legless llddier was\\nsawing away aft the tuna the cow evl- |\\ndently must have died on.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI canâ\\x80\\x99t kick,â\\x80\\x9d he said and continued\\nhis sawing.\\nThe Blind Fiddler.\\nThe blind fiddlier is a recent Importa\\ntion, having come to Birmingham only a\\ncouple of years ago. His name is Robert\\nA. Jtackson, as he will politely Inform you\\nshould yon ask him. He 1Â® a native Ala- 1\\nbamian, was born in â\\x80\\x9cHighâ\\x80\\x9d Jackson\\ncounty fifty years ago. He Is by no\\nmerits a grumbler at his hard lot, being\\nof a philosophical turn of mind. Should\\nyou ask him he will tell you tha t he was\\nonly 9 mon ths old when by an unfortun\\nate accident he lost the sight of both\\nt-yes. He fell In a fire and when taken\\nout had lost his sight. In later years he\\nwas taught the ant of making music with\\na fid-lie ami bow, and soon became an |\\nadept. When he had reached the age of\\nmattiI\\'M;,- he attempted to earn a liveli\\nhood at beaching vlollni lessons, bub his\\ninfirmity was a bar and he was forced to\\ntake hie fiddle and go upon the highways\\nand earn a living.\\nWhie on a tour of Hhe Lone Star state\\nhe s\\'-1tied down in Texarkana and tlmre\\nmarried. The result of his marital lifâ\\x80\\x9d\\nâ\\x96\\xa0was a. bright little girl. The mother died\\nand the child is now in kindly hands at\\nPratt City. Ask the blind m I net r el how\\nhis lllitie daughter is and his face becomes\\nbright and he 9\\'cnis to forget for the time\\nhis lrlflrmity and he speaks oheerlngly of\\nher. Ilia-address betokens good breeding,\\nn.nd he is not at all disagreeable to cun\\nverse with.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cHow is business with you today. Mr.\\nJackson?â\\x80\\x9d naked the reporter.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cOut of sight,â\\x80\\x9d replied he arid he con\\ntinned his rnedly.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cDo you know my tin box Is a chrono\\nmoteft quhrled he of the reporter.\\n\"Well, no, I don\\'t see how it is,\" reput\\'d\\nthe reporter.\\n\"I\\'ll tell you,â\\x80\\x9d he said, \"when the\\nriokUa fall regularly I know the people\\na,re doing well, but when they come f w\\nand far between 1 kno-w times are hard.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\"Quite philosophical,â\\x80\\x9d thought \\'the re\\nporter as he moved away.\\nThe Armless fiddler.\\nThe latest acquisition to the mendicant\\nranks is a man with only one arm. He,\\ntoo. is a fiddler. You will ask him how he\\nmbnflgos to make music with a fiddle and\\nbow, having only one arm. I will tell you.\\nHe places the how under his knee joint,\\ngrasps the fiddle wi|h the single hand\\nand by a swinging motion of til â\\x96\\xa0 body\\nforces the strains from the Instrument.\\nThe musi\\'o is by no means melodious, yet\\nIt is the best he can do and he deserves\\nail the nickels ho receives during the day.\\nThere is rot a day laborer In the city who\\nworks as faithfully or bard as he doeÂ»,\\nStill he never has anything to say, but\\ncontinues his sawirrg.

She really ex\\ncites one\\'s pity. A: times when the nick\\nels do not come fast enough she consoles\\nherself by humming an almost inaudible\\ntuneâ\\x80\\x94a song without words.\\n\"By the way, this reminds me of an oc\\ncurrence I witnessed a day or two ago,\\nIn Which â\\x80¢this lain- woman and the blind\\nfiddler were the principal figures. ! say\\nthe principal figures because the tnan\\ngot rhe money and rhe woman got left.\\nThree elegantly dressed women past! d\\n\\'the comer where 1 was standing The\\nlone woman was seat\\'d at the corner of\\nt.h*e Florence an-d th-o blind musician sat\\nB few steps away up the street.

This was a\\n! unique form of enforced sympathy strike,\\nwhich Mr. Grundy \\'has never since seen,\\n, duplicat\\'d. He had sometimes would ed\\nj at the; tameness of labor struggles which\\nhe has since wi\\'trJtws cl compare id with\\nj what he saw in his boyhood\\'s days, but\\ni as he remembers his feeling on Uie gi\\'eat\\noccasion it was simply on * of eailsfacth n\\nthat the strlk rs should icll ve him of the\\nnecessity of going to school\\nAccording to Mr. Grundy\\'s description!\\nelf this strike it must have been one of the\\ngi\\'-\\'atest labor struggles that ever occur\\nt d. In 1842 the condition of the oott< n\\nI workers in Lancashire, I Yorkshire\\nCheshire had become ro had, owing to\\nthe ir.i.\\'i\\'odutSt\\'iinn of machinery, that a\\nI p-ticral strike movement was brought\\n! about without an,y organization and at\\n1 first without leadership.\\nI On Its spontaneous character it seems to\\nI have much resembled the present min\\n! ers\\' ptrlke now on In half a dozen states,\\nthough Mr.Grundy Insists that th- mine s\\nhave possessed groat advantages for tha\\nInauguration of a general str ke com\\npared with wha. the weavers liad on â\\x80\\x98.hat\\noccasion, as the latter were absolutely\\nwithout any organization whatever. Lur\\ning the six weeks industry of every kind\\nwas entirely susp nded in the district\\naffected, i\\'. being estimated tha: in the\\nneighborhood of 3.600.000 people w-re idle.\\nTh.s included the weavers themselv s and\\np rsons of every other occupation whom\\nthey obliged to leave work. The small\\ntrad .-men and manufacturers were oblig\\ned to close their places, the teachers In\\nthe schools had to send their pupils home\\nand .he strikers even prevented tbe pa*Â«\\n, ing of vehicles upon the highways by\\nmas-lug themselves in compact bodl-s\\nthrough which no h\\'orse onuld be driven.\\nBlr. Grundy bavirg been very young\\n! Â«t \\'the time this strike occurred, most r.f\\nhis Information about \\' has been gath\\nered from reading. The incidents which\\n\\'he remembered are principally the forcing\\nof ills teacher to dismiss school and the\\n| obliging . f his father to suspend husl\\nne.-s. llr. Grundy\\'s father was a hatt-r,\\nhaving a shop of his own and employing\\na few hands in the town of Ashton, near\\no inc.ii si o\\'. Th\" strikers came i-- a\\nlarge body, and It was only necessary\\nj for one of them to say: \"Put out that fire,\\nI Grundy,â\\x80\\x9d and the \\'hatter immediately\\n: suspended ail work in his lit\\'tlo place and\\nsent his men home to wait for the strike\\nto be over.\\nMr. Grundy remembers seeing bodies\\nof the strikers marching along the high\\nways thickly massed \\'togeth r and fill\\ning the roads from, side to side as far as\\nthey could bÂ° s en. They were always\\narmed with clubs, and when marching\\nwould line up together, each grasping\\nthe club of the man on either side of\\nhint, and so weaving themselves Into a\\nsolid mass. In tills way It was rend r d\\nimpossible for anything or anybody to\\noccupy the road bu\\'t the strikers, and\\ntheir object of forcing a general suspen\\nsion of business in the district was ob\\ntained. This wa.s only for a little while,\\nhowever, as large bodl-s of troops of\\nthe empire were ordered into the dis\\ntrict held by the strikers, and soon\\nobliged them to pres rvr the peace and\\ndesist from interfering with the affairs\\nof those who desired to carry on busi\\nness.\\nMr. Grundyâ\\x80\\x99s recollection of the m tier\\nis that much sympathy was displayed\\nfor th- strik-rs by th- troops, and \\'that\\nthe latter were of very little use so far\\nas breaking the strike of the weavers\\nwas concerned. The strike was lost,\\nâ\\x80\\x99tow v-r, the weavers going back to\\ntheir work a\\'t llie end of six weeks with\\nout having obtained any increase of\\nwages or ary shortening of th It- hours\\nof labor. It was not long, however, un\\ntil parliament, as a result of this strike,\\nb-gan to pay tom\" att-ntion to the con\\ndition of the weavets. an\\'d laws which\\nserved very effectually to ameliorate\\ntheir condition were passed.\\nO\\'bden, Bright and other great English\\nstatesmen took up their cause, and inves\\ntigations and discussions resulted, the\\ngood effects of which are still frit. The\\nrepeahof the corn laws, by which English\\nworkingmen were enaheld to obtain\\ncheaper food, Mr. Grundy thinks, was\\nlargely due to this trike, though It had\\nbeen advocated before the strike took\\nplace. Another law which was of great\\nbenefit forbade women and children un\\nd r 18 years of ago to be employed in the\\netton mills longer than ten hours a day.\\nThis law was not only a good thing in it\\ns, If. but it caused the work rs gener\\nally to think and agitate for a general\\nter.-hour day. and sonic ten years aft\"r\\nthe gr at strike of 1842 there was a gen\\neral strike for t n hours, which resulted\\nsuccessfully, and which was the begin\\nning of better times In the matter of\\n1; til\\'s if labor In early all English in\\ndustries.\\nvt:-. Grundy was employed In a cotton\\nmil! 1 n-self at the time this last strike\\ntook place. The workingmen simply\\nquit work nipn they hail worked ten\\n, hours one day, and so Inaugurated a\\nmo\\'-i ment which was successful. Mr.\\nGian iy says that at that time there was .\\na. little gen.ral education that many\\npersons could not tell the time of day\\nby a click, and so in passing around the\\nword f. i the inauguration of the strike\\neverybody wa.s instructed to stop work\\nvriv r. the clock pointed straight up and\\ndown, this being a method of souring a\\nâ\\x96\\xa0more general understHruling than to say\\n6 o\\'clock In the evening.\\n\\' In the mill where Mr. Grundy worked\\nthe clock was watched all aft rnoin, and\\nwh\\'-n the time cam- there was a general\\nrush for the uts de of the mill. Th- fio e\\n,man hid the gates locked and â\\x80\\x9cproceeded\\nâ\\x80¢to\\'harangue\\'.he workmen, but It was to\\nm purpose. Several were notified that\\nthey were discharged, but this produced\\nn.i â\\x80\\x99off. ct upon them or th\" others. Mr.\\nGrundy, thinks limit among ignorant\\nworkm n, that is, \\'among \\'.hni-e who are\\nIgnore re in the minster of education ob\\ntained from honks, there 1ms b\"0r. nn\\na j-ei more lov-fiy to each e.â\\x80\\x98Un[â\\x80¢ dis\\nplayed than by those who are fairly edu\\ncated. At any rate, \\'.Jiey stuck together\\nupon this occasion, and won th\"ir strlk*\\nso â\\x80¢thoroughly that there was never after\\nwards a genual return to \\'the old prac\\ntice of working twelve to fifteen h airs\\nâ\\x96\\xa0a day.

Arrant semen ts\\nhad beo.â\\x80\\x99t made to thaJt end by gentlemen\\nwho \\'had mastered \\'\\'lira EiibJ vV.\\n\"The pr. t ,nt plant, ereoixd by the Bir\\nmingham rolling mlill, is In no B irate an\\ncxperlnaeinU X. was ocmt\\'t\\'iucted after a\\nmoist lW/Uient o:nd t\\'h!( dough examUtnia\\'ldon\\nof dthetr stiael plainttii, nlnld in the light of\\neuecefvsful experience flm the conversion\\nof similar lion initio at tell. \\'Had there been\\na neasorialble doubt so uo the outcome,\\ndie \\'in.teiligen/t manage merit directing that\\ncompany could have done all the expepi\\nrn, duing required at a, fraction! of tho\\ncoBt they aire iincrinilng. They have\\neiuct/ed and fitlilshied one furnace, Which is\\nnow In successful opeiraiJkm, and turning\\n, out on a single shift Viweroty-five tons of\\nsire (1 per day, Vhait hlas stood the severest\\nphysical nir.,.l any illieal teste. Their Bec\\noaid furnace will be Completed by sflie\\n1st of September; cunjd Vive two will tyave a\\noapaoSty, ruin on full time, of 125 to 150\\ntorp per d\\'ay. Their rolling mill to now\\nbeing overhaul,3, stuck Via ken, and being\\nput in, complete repair, and new and im\\nproved machinery baling put In to handle\\niJh\\'e pnod\\'uctof th1.ilr s\\' eel furnaces. /When\\nin full blast the steel furnaci ,s and rolling\\nmill will employ aiboult 1,300 skilled me\\ncthan/Ics, whose wages will average about\\n$3 per d\\'ay. The milling mill will pmuae\\noperaliiotys jn abou\\'c tan clays.\\nâ\\x80\\x9c1 do n-vt think that any One need ap\\npr \\'JrcirugL Vlhiat there will be any failure to\\nmoke, good m rclian\\'table steel at a cost\\nthat will leave a comfoiViable margin of\\nprofit to the manufacturers.\\n\"There ate many who can remember\\nthut when the attempt was first\\nmade to convert our Red mountain ore\\nIntolpig with coke from this district, that\\nit was proclaimed, at home and abroad,\\nthat it could not be done. It was said\\nthat the ore mutt have a large mixture\\nof the -brown or soft ore, and that It\\nwould otherwise be unmerchantable, and\\nthat financial disaster was inevitable.\\n\"After the iron was successfully made,\\nit was then said that \\\\0 Held of useful\\nness was so circumscribed that only a\\nlimited market could be found. In spite\\nof thtse prophesies furtcice after furnace\\nwas erected, our iion met the Pennsyl\\nvania and Ohio pig in many markets and\\ndrove them from the Held, and is now\\nfinding markets in England, Germany,\\nItaly, Spain and other foreign eountri. s.\\nIt has met the distrust and disaster pre\\ndicted in its beginnings and has estab\\nlished the fact that for general mill and\\nfoundry purposes it is as good as any in\\nthe world and produced at a less cost\\nthan at any other point in the world.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cI am satisfied that our experience in\\nthe manufacture of steel will follow\\ntho same lines and attain like results;\\ndistrust, and prejudice will have their\\nbrief day of opposition, obstacles will\\nbe overcome, the cost of production di\\nminished, and the market will in the end\\nonly be limited by freight charges.\\n\"It is quite likely flint within a de\\ncade the enttre product of our furnaces\\nwill be converted Into steel or manufac\\ntured here at home.\\n\"It Is the law of evolution and the law\\nof business that has evolved the steel\\nplant.\\nâ\\x80\\x9cThis law will continue in operation:\\nThe production of steel will be \\'the prolific\\nparent of many small industries. Ev.ry\\narticle of general use and consumption\\nInto which steel and iron and wood enters,\\nwill find here the point of lowest cost fjr\\ntheir raw mate,rials and the cheapest fuel\\nanywhere in tho United States; agricul\\ntural Implements, wagons, buggi s, car\\nriages, birycl e, toclE, nails, cli tins, tacks,\\nhorseshoes and numberless other artic es\\nwill here be manufactured. In these days\\nwhen the fraction of a cent often deter\\nmines the market capital will root be slow\\n\\'to find Ilia point where the raw materials\\nare cheapest.\\nThe same laws that are bringing the\\ncotton mills t> th* cotton fields will br\\'ng\\ntht se other manufacturing estaibli ti\\nmonth to the Birmingham district.\\nThe effect on the values oif coal an I iron\\nlands and city ar.i:l suburban ptoperly c n\\nbe calculated by others as accurately as\\nby myself. I believe, however, that tho\\nindications named will secure a healthy\\nand steady and per.-lsten\\'t growth both In\\npoulation and values, and will create an\\never increasing demand for the produc s\\nof our gardens and orchards and fields.\\nâ\\x80\\x9c DE LITE ON\\nTEXAS HILL.â\\x80\\x9d\\nFor the Age-Herald.\\n\"Yas. suh, mats ter d tv\\'s bin er he p\\ner funny things d...\\'s hapen\\'d t.v dat o e\\nhouse yer see up dur aâ\\x80\\x9e\\'_ou his 1kji\\\\,i\\'\\nplantashun,\" repli d the \"old man who\\ngave us water at the well by the road\\nsid , in answer to our question. \"1 dis\\nremember dis now mos\\' all dot dry has\\nbin. but 1 spec- ef yer hain t in er .hurry\\ni kit., toll j r er tale de likes er whicn\\nyer nebtr tv-tyrd befo\\'; an\\' hit\\'s de\\n1 Bold\\'s iruf i brj woid of It t.\\nj \"Yer f - we ail\\'s quality folks, we Is;\\nan\\' (lore Ivaln\\'t ti. ber bin, fus\\'t an\\' lasâ\\x80\\x99,\\n] but two stranger nlgg ts on dis place.\\n\" Bong bout de fust fall art r d â\\x80¢ svar\\n| (Here wus en pow\\'ful likely yoller boy\\n| name Bum cum by cr. day tin\\' , I â\\x80¢ m.Â»r\\ni ster hired â\\x80\\x99im fo wuek er bout d â\\x96\\xa0 house,\\nt sued h- was er pu\\' wii.t.-V n.gg r a:..â\\x80\\x99\\ndidn\\'t teck n,, st rk in \\'itn fiu.v. d s;.. t,\\nj uldo he had â\\x80\\x99is manners wid \\'itn anâ\\x80\\x99\\nâ\\x80\\x99liav hisvelf ebery whar.\\n\"Well, suit; dat nlgjr. r sab i eb.y c ivt\\ndat ole master paid him.

He possesses a good\\nhonest crop of whiskers, not of the Pef\\nferlne style, but more on the order of\\n\"Hillyâ\\x80\\x9d Morrison\\'s. He is over six feet\\nand walks in an easy farmer-like way,\\nâ\\x80¢his head tilted a little over his chest and)\\nhis hands swinging.\\nHis eyes are deep set and over them\\nhangs heavy eyebrows. His face is\\nnigged, yet soft. His Ideal of farm\\nlife he finds in the stories of southern\\n\\' plantation life before the war. II: looks\\nupon farming as one of the high arts,\\ncertainly not lower in the scale of hu\\nman occupations than a profession.\\nHe holds to the opinion that it takÂ«s\\nmore brains to farm than it does to write\\nbooks. He is especially delighted when\\never he hears of the old southern repie\\nscntatlves returning to the plow. Instead\\nof the ignorant remaining on the farm\\nand the intellectual prodigy going to\\nthe city, he thinks that the fool should\\nseek city life ar.d the brother with\\nbrains remain on the farm.\\nWilson is less of a politician than Gage.\\nHe is essential?}â\\x80\\x99 a student.
